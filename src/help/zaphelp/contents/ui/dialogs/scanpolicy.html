<H1>Scan Policy dialog</H1>
<p>
This allows you to enable and disable the rules that are run when performing an <a href="../../start/concepts/ascan.html">active scan</a>.<br>
The first screen allows you to define the default levels as well as the levels for all of the rules in a specific category.<br>
<br>
The category screens allow you to define the levels for every individual rule.<br>
<br>
<br>
Note that <a href="../../start/concepts/pscan.html">passive scan</a> rules are no longer managed via this dialog but are instead 
managed via the <a href="../../ui/dialogs/options/pscanrules.html">Options Passive Scan Rules</a>.
</p>

<H3>Threshold</H3>
This controls how likely ZAP is to report potential vulnerabilities.<br>
If you select Low then more potential issues will be raised which may increase the number of false positives.<br>
If you select High then fewer potential issues will be raised which may mean that some real issues are missed (false negatives).  

<H3>Strength</H3>
This controls the number of attacks that ZAP will perform.<br>
If you select Low then fewer attacks will be used which will be quicker but may miss some issues.<br>
If you select High then more attacks will be used which may find more issues but will take longer.<br>
The Insane level should typically only be used for small parts of an application as it can result in a very large number of 
attacks being used, which can take a considerable length of time.
